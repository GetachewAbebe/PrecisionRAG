Prompt Tuning For Building Enterprise Grade - RAG Systems
# Automatic Prompt Engineering

This project aims to develop an enterprise-grade Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system by automating the prompt engineering process. The goal is to create a comprehensive solution that simplifies the task of crafting effective prompts for Language Models (LLMs), enabling businesses to leverage advanced AI capabilities more efficiently.

## Key Features

1. **Automatic Prompt Generation**: Automatically generate a diverse set of prompt options based on user input and objectives, saving time and effort in manual prompt engineering.
2. **Automatic Evaluation Data Generation**: Automatically create test cases and scenarios to comprehensively evaluate the performance of prompt candidates, ensuring prompt effectiveness in various contexts.
3. **Prompt Testing and Ranking**: Implement robust prompt testing and ranking mechanisms, such as Monte Carlo matchmaking and ELO rating systems, to objectively evaluate and prioritize the most effective prompts.
4. **User-Friendly Interface**: Develop a intuitive user interface to streamline the prompt engineering process, allowing users to input requirements, view generated prompts, and analyze evaluation results.
